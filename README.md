# AR Marker 3D Model Viewer

This project uses **A-Frame** and **AR.js** to display 3D models on AR markers in the browser.

When an AR marker is detected by the camera, the corresponding 3D model is rendered in real-time on top of it.

## Features

- Marker-based AR using AR.js
- Support for GLTF/GLB 3D models
- Runs in the browser (no app install required)
- Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use

1. Open the web app in a browser with camera access.
2. Point the camera at the designated AR marker.
3. The linked 3D model will appear aligned with the marker.
